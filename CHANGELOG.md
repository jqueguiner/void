# Changelog

All notable changes to Void CLI are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Circleback** — new read-only connector for [Circleback](https://circleback.ai) meetings. Each meeting becomes a conversation carrying its notes, its action items and (optionally) every transcript turn, so meeting content is searchable alongside messages. Configure with `api_key`, `backfill_days` (default 365) and `include_transcript` (default true); `void setup` has a wizard for it.
- **Gmail** — `void gmail search` and `void gmail thread` read from the local INBOX store when a usable body is already synced. `--live` forces the Gmail API (`in:sent`, drafts, and unsynced mail still go to the network).
- **Gmail** — Cross-process token bucket (~90 requests / 60s per account, stored in SQLite) so the CLI and sync daemon share quota instead of stampeding after a 429.
- **Remote** — `void remote status` reports `local_version` and `remote_version` so version skew between the client and the server binary is visible at a glance.

### Fixed

- **Slack** — Retry HTTP 5xx and retryable JSON errors (`internal_error`, `fatal_error`) on every GET/POST, including sends, with the same `Retry-After` backoff as 429.
- **Gmail** — Retry transient API failures (429, 5xx, and 403 `rateLimitExceeded`) with exponential backoff, honouring `Retry-After` and the retry timestamp in Google's error body.
- **WhatsApp** — `void send` / `void reply` no longer report success on a dead or dying socket. Sends fail fast when the connection is down, and after the write a ping must round-trip before success is printed; if it does not, the command exits non-zero and says delivery is unknown.
- **WhatsApp** — History sync after pairing is stored again. The library now delivers the backfill one conversation at a time, so the old bulk handler never ran and the pairing dump was dropped (observed: 775 conversations parsed, 4 rows stored). Progress is logged every 250 messages.
- **Archive** — `void archive <id>` now dismisses the whole context group behind the item (Slack thread, Slack 1-hour channel group, Gmail thread) instead of a single row. The inbox shows one row per context, so archiving only the visible id let an older sibling resurface as the next representative. The response gains `archived_count` (rows newly archived by the call, `0` when it was already archived), and Gmail pushes the group in one `batchModify` request.
- **Remote** — Proxied write commands print a warning on stderr when the server's `void` is a different version than the local client, instead of surfacing confusing `unexpected argument` errors from the older remote binary.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp** — Sync no longer leaves the account looking permanently online. Void overrides `wa-rs`'s automatic `available` presence with `unavailable` on connect, after push-name sync, after sends, and on a periodic refresh so contacts stop seeing you as always online and phone notifications keep working.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **GitHub** — New read-only connector that syncs open PRs requesting your review, comments on your authored PRs, and @mentions via GitHub notifications. Each repository maps to a conversation so `void mute owner/repo` works at repo level. Configure via `void setup`.
- **Reddit** — New connector that polls watched subreddits and surfaces posts matching your keywords and minimum score (one channel conversation per subreddit). Read-only mode uses application-only OAuth (`client_id` + `client_secret`); enabling commenting during `void setup` runs a browser OAuth flow, stores a `refresh_token`, syncs matching posts as comment threads, and lets you reply via `void reply` / `void send --via reddit`. Tune filters at runtime with `void reddit subreddits|keywords|min-score|config`.
- **Google News** — New read-only connector that watches the public Google News RSS feed. Each configured keyword triggers its own search; matching articles land in your inbox, filtered by a recency window. Configure with `void gn keywords`, `void gn when`, `void gn language`, and `void gn country` (or interactively via `void setup`). Language/country default to `fr`/`FR`; add one connection per edition to follow several.
- **MCP** — `void mcp` stdio server: named read/write tools (`inbox`, `conversations`, `messages`, `search`, `contacts`, `channels`, `slack_saved`, `calendar`, `health`, `send`, `reply`, `forward`, `archive`, `mute`) plus a `run` tool for full CLI parity via subprocess. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).
- **Gmail** — `--cc` / `--bcc` on draft create/update, `void send --via gmail`, `void reply`, `void forward`, and `void gmail forward` (comma-separated). Headers are placed after `To` and before `Subject`/MIME so Gmail honors them.
- **Gmail** — `--signature` / `--signature-from <email>` append the account HTML signature from Gmail send-as settings on all outgoing compose paths: `void gmail draft create` / `draft update`, `void send --via gmail`, `void reply`, `void forward`, and `void gmail forward`. Pass a body/comment without an existing signature (append is not idempotent). Forwards place the signature between the comment and the quoted message. First interactive use may open a browser to grant `gmail.settings.basic` (not requested at normal setup); non-interactive / MCP callers must grant that scope once via an interactive `--signature` command (`void setup` re-auth does not).
- **Slack** — Sync "Saved for Later" items from the Later view during background sync; view with `void slack saved`. Setup wizard documents the required `search:read` scope.
- **Sync** — Supervised mode auto-restarts connectors and the WhatsApp RPC server on failure with exponential backoff (5 s → 5 min, reset after 60 s stable, give up after 10 consecutive failures).

### Changed

- **Internal** — Service layer (`crates/void-cli/src/service/`) extracting read/write business logic shared by CLI commands and the MCP server.
- **Internal** — Connector wiring uses a compile-time plugin registry (`inventory`). `ConnectorType` is a string newtype; connection settings are a generic TOML table. Adding a connector no longer edits ~13 central files. Connection settings are validated at setup reload, sync start, and `void doctor`. Poll intervals are read from `[sync]` via the generic `{id}_poll_interval_secs` keys. No user-facing CLI behavior change.
- **MCP** — `run` resolves the first non-flag token as the subcommand, rejects global CLI flags inside args, and omits informational stderr on successful JSON/`stdout`-empty results.
- **Build** — Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.95 (required by sysinfo 0.39).

### Fixed

- **Gmail** — Reject CR/LF and other ASCII control characters in `To` / `Cc` / `Bcc` so address fields cannot inject extra RFC 2822 headers (CLI and MCP compose paths).
- **WhatsApp** — The daemon's RPC socket no longer disappears from disk, which broke every `void send --via whatsapp` with `No such file or directory`. A second `void sync` used to unlink the running daemon's socket before discovering it could not take the lock; the sync lock is now acquired before the RPC endpoint is touched, a live endpoint is never replaced, and a watchdog rebinds the socket if it vanishes anyway (manual `rm`, `/tmp` pruning).
- **WhatsApp** — File attachments now work in notes-to-self sends.
- **Sync** — A lock file whose PID has been recycled by an unrelated process is now treated as stale instead of "another sync instance is running", so `void sync --restart` starts cleanly and `void sync --stop` can no longer signal a stranger. `--restart` also clears a lock that survives the stop.
- **Slack** — Inaccessible saved items (left channels, deleted messages) are skipped instead of aborting the entire saved-sync pass.
- **Inbox** — Bulk archive (`archive --before`) no longer archives backfilled messages before they appear in the inbox, and upsert no longer overwrites user archive decisions on re-sync.
- **Messages** — Restore UTC midnight semantics for `void messages --since/--until` date filters during service-layer extraction (calendar date ranges remain local midnight).

### Removed

- **Google Drive** — Removed the `void drive` command and `void-gdrive` crate. Drive file download was on-demand utility code outside void's inbox/sync model; use Gmail attachments or a dedicated Google Drive tool instead.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp** — Notes-to-self sends (`--to` your own number or `--conversation` for "Message yourself") were acknowledged by linked devices but never delivered to the primary phone; sends now use the regular DM path to your phone JID instead of a broken custom LID stanza.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **Gmail** — `void send --via gmail --subject` was accepted by the CLI but ignored; new emails were always sent with `(no subject)`. The subject is now passed through to the Gmail API.
- **WhatsApp (Windows)** — The named-pipe RPC server failed after the first request (`first_pipe_instance` was set on every pipe instance) and had unused-import build warnings under `-D warnings`. The Windows sync-daemon send/reply path now works across multiple requests.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-14

> Supersedes 0.10.0, which was tagged but never published (its Windows release build failed).

### Added

- **WhatsApp** — Support for the "Message yourself" (notes-to-self) chat: `send` and `reply` now detect and route to the notes-to-self conversation, including via the new `send --conversation <id>` flag.

### Changed

- **Telegram** — Replaced the raw-memory `unsafe` transmute of `PeerAuth` with the crate's safe accessors and a fixed little-endian encoding (no behavior change for existing little-endian session files).

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp** — Messages are now stored under the config connection id instead of the account JID, so history stays attached to the right connection.
- **WhatsApp** — RPC server now builds on Windows (uses `tokio::io::split` for named pipes instead of the Unix-only `into_split`).
- **Docs** — Corrected the `calendar respond --status` values (`accepted|declined|tentative`) and added the missing Hacker News command reference.

### Security

- **Credentials at rest** — `config.toml`, OAuth token caches, the Telegram session file, and the WhatsApp session DB are now written owner-only (`0600`, parent dir `0700`) on Unix instead of inheriting world-readable permissions. Other local users can no longer read your tokens/session keys.
- **Drive download path traversal** — `void drive download` (without `--output`) derived the destination from the attacker-controlled remote file name; a name like `../../../.zshrc` could write outside the working directory. The auto-derived name is now reduced to a single sanitized path component.
- **Remote store shell quoting** — tilde-prefixed remote paths sourced from config are now properly escaped before being passed to the remote login shell (scp specs and the daemon lock-file check), closing a command-injection gap against your own remote host.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Docs** — New [deployment modes](docs/deployment.md) guide explaining the two ways to run void (all-local vs sync on an always-on server) with trade-offs and a migration path; the README now summarizes both modes.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** — Bumped reqwest (0.13), toml (0.9), sysinfo (0.39), and a group of minor/patch updates.

### Fixed

- **Remote mode** — Download commands (`gmail attachment`, `whatsapp download`, `telegram download`, `linkedin download`) failed on a fresh remote store because the remote staging directory was only created by `--file` uploads. The staging directory is now created before download-only proxied commands, and download handlers create the output file's parent directories (matching `drive download`).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Homebrew** — Fixed automatic tap formula updates on release (deploy-key authentication instead of a cross-repo PAT).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **License** — Relicensed from GPL-3.0-only to **AGPL-3.0-only** to close the network-use (SaaS) loophole. As sole author, no contributor consent was required.
- **Dependencies** — Bumped rusqlite (0.39), tokio-tungstenite (0.29), croner (3.0), html-to-markdown-rs (3.0), and a group of minor/patch updates.
- **MSRV** — Raised the declared minimum supported Rust version to 1.89 (the real floor required by the dependency tree; the previously declared 1.75 did not build).
- **CI** — Added macOS to the test matrix, `--locked` builds, and new MSRV, `cargo deny`, and coverage jobs.
- **Tests** — Added ~100 tests (binary CLI integration, sync-engine orchestration, schema migrations, FTS5 fuzzing, hook execution, remote-store proxy, and per-connector API error paths). See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).
- **Docs** — Restructured the README around a quick start and everyday examples, and split deep material into modular guides (`docs/`): command reference, configuration, connector setup, hooks, remote store, testing.
- **Community** — Added contribution guide, security policy (including embedded OAuth client documentation), code of conduct, issue/PR templates, and Dependabot configuration.

### Removed

- **Agent** — Removed the unused rig-core-based interactive agent mode (`void agent`) and its crate. Hooks (`void hook`) are unaffected.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Calendar** — Auto-include the calendar account owner in the attendee list when creating events with `--attendees` (the organizer was omitted from Google Calendar API requests).
- **Remote** — Stage file attachments over SCP in proxied commands so send/reply with `--file` works in remote store mode.

### Changed

- **Docs** — Improved README quick start install instructions, including a curl one-liner.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Remote store** — Full remote store mode with SSH proxy and local cache: run sync on a home server, use `void` locally against the same data (`store.mode = "remote"`, `void remote status`, `void remote refresh`).
- **Doctor** — Added `--non-interactive` flag for scriptable health checks.
- **LinkedIn** — Sync comments on your own posts via Unipile Posts & Comments API (one thread per post, nested comment replies, `void reply` on post comments).
- **LinkedIn** — Catch-up after sleep/idle (wall-clock idle detection, progress on resume, same as Slack/Gmail).
- **Hacker News** — Catch-up after sleep/idle with visible progress when resuming from hibernation.

### Fixed

- **Calendar** — Incremental sync now works: initial backfill no longer uses `orderBy` (which prevented Google from returning a sync token), and a bootstrap step acquires the token for ongoing updates.
- **Config** — Auto-create default config on first run instead of erroring.
- **Gmail** — Paginate `list_history` to avoid silently dropping events.
- **Gmail** — Preserve HTML when forwarding messages.
- **Inbox** — Thread dedup no longer hides threads with newer archived messages.
- **LinkedIn** — Run catch-up on daemon start when backfill is already complete (missed messages while void was stopped).
- **Slack** — Skip external/Google and thumbnail-only attachments when caching files; prefer `url_private_download` to avoid repeated 404/401 warnings.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **LinkedIn** — New connector via the Unipile API: sync direct messages, send, reply, and download attachments (`void linkedin download`).
- **LinkedIn** — Setup wizard and config fields (`api_key`, `dsn`, `account_id`); sync tuning via `linkedin_poll_interval_secs` and `linkedin_backfill_days` (default 15-day backfill).
- **LinkedIn** — Resolved sender display names, profile URLs, and avatars from Unipile user/attendee APIs.
- **CLI** — `void messages linkedin` / `void messages li` lists recent LinkedIn messages; contact names resolve to a conversation when unambiguous.
- **Agent** — Void Agent prompt and tools updated for LinkedIn inbox, send, reply, and media download.

### Fixed

- **Search** — Full-text search no longer deduplicates by conversation context, so older messages in a thread remain findable after a newer reply.
- **Search** — Conversation display names are included in search results alongside message body and sender name.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Hooks** — Added `active_window` to restrict hook execution to specific days and hours.
- **Hooks** — Added per-hook `extra_args` (a generic argv passthrough) so hooks can forward any agent-specific CLI flags without `void` having to know their spelling. All agent-specific flags — model selection, tool permissions, etc. — are the hook author's responsibility. Example: `extra_args = ["--model", "sonnet", "--dangerously-skip-permissions"]`.

### Changed

- **Hooks** — Replaced dedicated `model`, `allowed_tools`, and `dangerously_skip_permissions` fields with the generic `extra_args` passthrough.
- **Sync** — Status logs now include timestamps; Slack is re-synced on any reconnect.

### Fixed

- **Hooks** — When an agent exits non-zero with an empty stderr (e.g. Claude rate-limit rejections), the error surfaced on the console and in logs was blank. The executor now parses the stream-json stdout and extracts the final `result` / `rate_limit_event` record, so failures show something like `claude exited with exit status: 1: [HTTP 429, rate_limit=five_hour] You've hit your limit …`.
- **Slack** — Thread replies are now fetched during backfill.
- **Slack** — Permalinks are resolved via the native `(channel, ts)` pair.
- **Slack** — Real-time messages ingested via Socket Mode now carry the same metadata as backfilled ones (`channel_id`, `channel_name`, `channel_kind`, optional `thread_ts`). Previously plain-text events ended up with `metadata: null`, which broke downstream consumers that relied on the channel name (e.g. notification hooks).
- **Sync** — Broken connectors now surface errors instead of being silently skipped.
- **Log** — Status macro output now uses full ISO-8601 timestamps.

### Removed

- **Knowledge Base** — Removed the `void kb` command and the entire Knowledge Base feature (daemon, indexing, and related config).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Config** — Added `ignore_conversations` option to any connection. Matching conversations are auto-muted on every sync start (case-insensitive substring match on name or external ID).
- **Sync** — Added `--status` flag to show daemon and connector state, outputting as JSON.
- **Contacts** — Added profile picture (`avatar_url`) to contacts and backfilled URLs for existing messages.
- **Doctor** — Added connection health checks and offered re-authentication on failure.
- **CLI** — Added connector-specific forward subcommands for Gmail, Slack, and Telegram.

### Changed

- **Setup** — Slack re-authentication now keeps existing tokens on empty input and populates them as defaults.
- **Setup** — Slack re-authentication prints the refresh token save path to clarify it's not in config.toml.
- **Codebase** — Split large modules (hooks, config) and extracted duplicated forward helpers to a shared module.

### Fixed

- **CLI** — Fixed pagination metadata (`total_elements`, `total_pages`) being inflated when context dedup removed messages from the result set. Count and data queries now apply identical filtering at the SQL level.
- **Gmail** — Included email subject in message metadata JSON.
- **Gmail** — Enforced base64 and HTML formatting for email bodies.
- **Calendar** — Validated and normalized datetime inputs to RFC 3339.
- **Slack** — Added idle watchdog to detect stale WebSockets after hibernation.
- **Slack / Gmail** — Caught up on missed messages after hibernation.
- **Doctor** — Included event subscription config token validity in the health check.
- **Doctor** — Correctly handled interactive re-authentication for Slack.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **CLI** — Added `--page` parameter and pagination metadata to all list commands.
- **Slack** — Downloaded files locally for auth-free access instead of requiring Slack tokens to view attachments.
- **Slack** — Retroactively downloaded files for previously synced messages on startup.
- **Slack** — Automatically deleted cached files when the parent message is archived.
- **Archive** — Added `--before` flag for bulk date-based archiving.

### Changed

- **Slack** — Removed unused `exclude_channels` config field.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Slack** — Auto-repair event subscriptions at sync startup. Slack silently disables event subscriptions when the CLI is not running for a while; void now detects this and restores them automatically via the App Manifest API.
- **Slack setup** — Added optional Step 6 to collect App ID and Config Refresh Token for the auto-repair feature.

### Fixed

- **Slack** — Always force-update the manifest on sync startup. Slack keeps events listed in the exported manifest even when the "Enable Events" toggle is OFF, so checking the manifest alone was unreliable.
- **Sync** — Prevented premature force-exit and improved shutdown signal logging.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Gmail** — Made `--to` optional on `void gmail draft create`; replies now default to reply-all recipients automatically.

### Changed

- **Gmail** — Removed `--thread-id` flag from draft create; thread is now auto-derived from `--reply-to` message.

### Fixed

- **Gmail** — Stripped internal ID prefix from `--reply-to` and `--thread-id` values so the Gmail API receives clean message IDs.
- **Build** — Gated `sysinfo::Signal` import to Unix targets to fix Windows compilation.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Cross-platform runtime** — Added Windows support for the sync daemon lifecycle, including detached background execution and stop handling.
- **Windows install script** — Added `scripts/build-install.ps1` for native PowerShell install/update workflow.
- **CI/Release** — Added Windows targets to CI and release packaging, including `void.exe` zip artifacts.

### Changed

- **Sync daemon** — Replaced Unix-only double-fork daemonization with a cross-platform re-exec daemon model and internal daemon mode routing.
- **Process management** — Switched stale-lock and daemon process checks to `sysinfo` for cross-platform behavior.
- **Configuration paths** — Made default config/store path resolution platform-aware using `dirs`, while preserving legacy Unix path compatibility when existing paths are present.
- **Agent shell execution** — Added OS-specific shell invocation (`sh -c` on Unix, `cmd /C` on Windows) and home directory resolution via `dirs`.
- **Codebase structure** — Split large connector modules and reorganized connector crate internals for maintainability.
- **Documentation** — Updated README to reflect daemon behavior (`void sync` foreground vs `void sync --daemon`), Windows install steps, and platform-specific config/storage paths.

### Fixed

- **CLI setup editor fallback** — Uses `notepad` by default on Windows instead of Unix-only editor assumptions.
- **Tests** — Replaced hardcoded `/tmp` paths with `std::env::temp_dir()` in connector/auth tests and added targeted edge-case coverage for config redaction, lock-file parsing, and Gmail auth cache loading.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Hacker News** — `void hn` subcommand to view and manage keywords and min-score from the CLI (`void hn config`, `void hn keywords`, `void hn min-score`)
- **Gmail** — `--file` attachment support on `void gmail draft create`, `void gmail draft update`, and `void reply`

### Changed

- **void-calendar** — Split monolithic connector into focused submodules (types, mapping, sync_ops, events)
- **void-cli** — Split setup wizard into per-connector modules for better maintainability
- **void-core** — Split database layer into focused submodules (schema, messages, conversations, contacts, search)
- Updated dependencies (env_logger, html-to-markdown-rs, html5ever, moka, ureq, and more)
- Expanded test coverage in void-core (models, links, config)

### Fixed

- **Gmail** — Inbox sync now mirrors the actual Gmail INBOX state; startup reconciliation ensures local `is_archived` flags match Gmail labels, and incremental sync handles `labelsAdded`/`labelsRemoved` events
- **Gmail** — Fixed `history_id` overwrite on daemon restart that caused missed incremental changes
- **Gmail** — Resolved clippy `collapsible_if` warning in incremental sync

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Fixed code formatting across all crates to pass CI

- **Telegram** — Seed session with production DC addresses and handle DC migration during QR login
- **Telegram** — Poll frequently during QR login to avoid token expiry
- **Telegram** — Fall through to `search_peer` when `resolve_username` fails
- **Telegram** — Use conversation PK (not `external_id`) for `message.conversation_id`
- **Hacker News** — Use conversation ID for message foreign key
- **Hacker News** — Removed meaningless context field from messages
- **WhatsApp** — Suppressed noisy `wa-rs` notification handler warning
- **Sync** — Let sync overwrite archive state instead of using sticky MAX
